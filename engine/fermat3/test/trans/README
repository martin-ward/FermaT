The WSL test files in this directory have been tested
and should all work.

The command "test-trans" will run all the transformation tests.

To run all the tests, save the result in a log file,
and check for any errors or failures, run:

source DOIT



The @Test_Trans procedure takes 6 arguments:

1: String to print before running the test
2: Initial program
3: Initial position
4: Transformation to apply
5: Data string, or empty list or string
6: Final program, or the string "Fail" (if the transformation
   is supposed to fail at that position in that program).
