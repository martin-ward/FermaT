# Options File for FermaT 2000
# 1 = Yes, 0 = No

# Should the analyser treat the listings as the starting point
# (and not attempt to do any assemblies itself)?
Listings	= 1

# Should the analyser process all subdirectories of the current
# directory before processing the current directory?
Recursion	= 1

# Keep the intermediate files?

# Seek table file name (this file must exist):

# to create a separate seek table for each module,
# which will be used by f2kprep and datescan:

# The seek table to use for crypscan.
# This file must exist if Cryp_Scan = 1:

# ... including structures which have an annotated field or subfield:
Declarations3	= 1

# Time (in hours of wall clock time) after which the analysis
# of a single file should be interrupted and the analyse script
# move on to the next file (if any).
# A value of 0 will allow the process to take as long as it needs.

#======== SCANNER OPTIONS ==============
# These are passed to the scanner programs when they
# are invoked by the date tracker.
# Currently, the scanner programs themselves do NOT read this file!

# Options for datescan:
Datescan_Opts	= "/e/w/x/l"

# Options for f2kprep:
Scanner_Opts	= "/e/w/l"

# Options for crypscan: (option /t is to scan text constants)
CrypScan_Opts	= ""

#======== CROSS REFERENCE ==============
# Highlight ALL references to annotated lines in 
# the cross reference listing -- even if the symbol is not a date carrier
Highlight_All	= 1

# Condensed cross reference listing -- only list annotated items:
Condensed_Xref	= 0

#============ OUTPUT ===================
# Should "analyse" script generate .ps file from .as5:
Generate_PS	= 1

# Should "analyse" script generate .lps file from .ls5:

# Number of lines of listing per page
# Use 92 for A4 paper; use 86 to 88 for 8.5 x 11" USA
Lines_On_Page	= 92

# Number of lines of context to print around each annotated line
# "-1" means print the whole file,
# "0" means only print the annotated lines (with no context):

# Set this to 1 if you only want the cross reference part of the listing:
Cross_Ref_Only  = 0

# Include Macro expansions in the PostScript listing:

# Include Copybook lines in the PostScript listing:

#============ FLOWCHART ===================

# Use many triangle nodes for dispatch?

# Connect BAL nodes and show dispatch nodes:

# Make backedge edges thinner:
Thin_Back_Edges = 1		

# Max number of lines in a label
# A label longer than (Max_Box_Lines1 + Max_Box_Lines2 + 1) lines

# Max number of chars/line in a rhomb (ie diamond) label:

# Max number of edges into a node (nodes with more than this many
# incoming edges will have the edges connected via triangle connectors.
# Use 0 to disable this option):

# Expand #GOTO...#LOCA macros in the flowchart:
Expand_Goto_Macros 	= 0

# Expand #DO...#DOEX...#EDO macros in the flowchart:
Expand_Do_Macros 	= 0

# Don't show the targets of EX instructions separately
# in the flowchart. Note that if the target of an EX can be found,
# then it will be copied in after each EX. This option
# assumes that the instructions are only reached
# via EXecute statements.
Delete_EXeced_Instrs	= 1

#============ MIGRATION ===================

# In translating an EXecuted instruction, use all of the register
# in the EX instruction as the length field (ie don't bother just
# extracting the low order byte):
EX_Full_Length	= 1
