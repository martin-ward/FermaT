Unix Installation Instructions



(1) Ensure you have perl 5.6.1 or later (perl -v will tell you
which version of perl is installed). See http://www.cpan.org

(2) Install the perl modules Bit::Vector and Set::IntRange:

% perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Bit::Vector
...
cpan> install Set::IntRange
...
cpan> quit

Or see http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Bit::Vector
and http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Set::IntRange

(3) Ensure you have gcc installed (gcc -v will tell you the version)
See http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html

(4) Download the gzipped tar file from:

http://www.gkc.org.uk/fermat3.tar.gz

(5) Unpack the archive:

% tar zxvf fermat3.tar.gz

This creates a directory called fermat3

(6) Change to the fermat3 directory and source the appropriate DOIT script
(DOIT.sh, DOIT.csh or DOIT.bash) into your shell:

% cd fermat3
% source DOIT.csh

(7) Type

% make test

to compile, install and test FermaT

You should (eventually) see the message "All files passed!"

Each time you log in to use FermaT you need to source the appropriate
DOIT file, unless you have added the appropriate lines to your
.profile or .cshrc file.




Windows Installation Instructions


You need a version of the GNU C compiler (gcc) and a version of perl
installed in order to build FermaT.

To install perl and the modules from ActiveState and
the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows):

(1) Download ActivePerl from http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl

(2) Reboot...

(3) Connect to the Internet, open a DOS box and run "ppm". At
the prompt, type:

ppm: install Bit::Vector
ppm: install Set::IntRange
ppm: quit

to install two perl packages needed by FermaT.

(4) Download MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/ and double click
on it to install gcc etc.

(5) Reboot...


To install FermaT on Windows:


(6) Download the gzipped tar file:

http://www.gkc.org.uk/fermat3.tar.gz

(7) Unpack the archive with a suitable utility.
PowerArchiver (https://www.powerarchiver.com/) and Winzip
http://www.winzip.com can both unpack tar.gz files.
This creates a directory called fermat3.

(8) Open a Windows DOS box, change to the fermat3 directory and run
the DOIT.bat batch file

(9) cd to the src directory and run the commands to
compile and test FermaT:

cd src
make-fermat -install
test-fermat
test-trans

You should (eventually) see the message "All files passed!"
